### Why impact in Data Science is key? 

#### In technology, finance, and every industry, impact will always trump science.

In today’s world of rapidly growing technological dependence, it's important to understand what is and has always been important... making an impact.
Impact provides value, changes lives and is a driver of business growth.  
<br>
In relation to Data Science and Machine Learning, did you know that most Machine Learning projects FAIL?  Did you also know that most Hedge funds that use Machine Learning to automate and influence investing or high frequency trading (HFT) also fail? 

What is impact and what does it look like in Data Science? - This can't be defined by an arbitrary value or by a specific event equating to impact. It can mean different things for different companies, an **impact** must be long lasting, and long felt, it must make a change no matter how small. This could be a change in perspective or insight because of your work as a data scientist. 

I don't mean to sound like a pessimist, but it’s simply the facts. Therefore, some succeed in their field and others don't. **Success is an outlier**. 

Personally, in everything I do, I want to have an impact. Otherwise, what is the point of doing what you're doing. If I am in a team and my impact is not being felt, then why the point of me being there is questionable? I understand that people in nature are different, but the fact still is in all you do, there must be an impact. If a person is not impactful in their position, you could lose it to someone else who will have an impact.  

Most companies today are attempting to join the data revolution and improve their processes around this to ultimately grow their business. These companies are looking for people to have an impact of their business. Do you have an impact in your work? 

In summary, I understand not everyone can be a Data Scientist, in the same way not everyone can be a footballer or an author - but whatever your industry, have an impact.
