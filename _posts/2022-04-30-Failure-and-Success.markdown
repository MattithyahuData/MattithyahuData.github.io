### *Do we really learn more from our failures than our success?*

[The below quotes were taken from the Article - Learning](https://mattithyahudata.github.io/jekyll/update/2022/03/14/Learning.html)
#### *"Failure and mistakes are inevitable - accept it, embrace it, and learn through it." - Mattithyahu* 
#### *"I whole heartedly believe the person that will go far in life and improve continuously is the person that is dedicated to learning everyday." - Mattithyahu*

**Failure and success go hand in hand.**

Our perception of failure is key in our progression and view of ourselves. I view all failures as learning opportunities and the outcomes of those failures as **progress**. 

**Failure and our goals**

Failure also shouldnâ€™t be missing an exact target. 

Sometimes we will feel like failures when we set an exact goal or outcome and we fall short of achieving it. This in my opinion is not right. Things don't always go as planned but we can't conclude that we are failures because the outcomes are different from what we expected. 

Know that failures are a part of success, it is a great sign that you're trying and it's then up to you to learn from it and hopefully grow from it.
