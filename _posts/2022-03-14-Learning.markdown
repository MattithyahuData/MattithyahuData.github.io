### How does one get better?... Learning.

Learning means different things to different people. It could mean practising, studying, or observing something but the fact is we all learn in unique ways. 

To me learning is just a review process, taking stock of the past and looking to the future to improve, even if it's just by a small amount. 

My definition of learning: 

A review process where you aim to do and be better than you were before. 
*Notice I said better than you were before and not *yesterday* as we usually can't put an arbitrary timeframe on when we will improve but we know it happens over time. 

My #1 key to learning: 

*   Know that you must learn. 
You must first know that you need to learn, to learn. Understanding that there is room for improvement and development in all you do will keep you open-minded to learning. 

**Learning** can be applied to:
*   Sports
*   Finance
*   Relationships
*   Fitness
*   Work
*   Anything, you name it! 

Learning is applicable in all we do as humans and thus is a key part of our life experience. Just as a child learns to take its first steps, we must maintain the same attitude of learning continuously through our lives. 

I personally think life is zero sum in relation to this topic. What I mean is that if you are not learning and therefore progressing then you are receding. I will give a few examples below to further explain this. 

Sports: If you are not getting stronger, you are getting weaker. Why do bodybuilders or strongmen continually train? Because it requires continuous learning i.e., training to maintain or improve. Without training they know that over time they will lose their gains and strength. 

Business: Tech giants like Amazon.com survived the .com bubble, the great recession and the fluctuating financial situation of the last 3 decades. Many companies from the .com bubble explosion do not exist today but companies like Apple and Amazon are still here and leading the way for new innovative technologies. These companies have reached these heights in my opinions because of a commitment to learn and develop along the way. The market has almost changed completely from the 90s, but they have developed with the times and continue to do so! 

In summary, **learning** is important. It is a key part of growth and progression.
